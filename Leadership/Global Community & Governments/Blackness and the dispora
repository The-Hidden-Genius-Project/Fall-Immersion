### **Lesson Plan Outline**

1. **Introduction to the Black Diaspora** (15-20 minutes)

   - **Lecture**: Introduce the concept of the Black or African Diaspora, explaining how, due to the transatlantic slave trade, colonization, migration, and more recent movements, people of African descent are found all over the world. Highlight that the Black Diaspora refers not only to people’s physical dispersion but also to the shared cultural, historical, and emotional connections across the globe.
   - **Map Activity**: Show a map of the African Diaspora across various continents (North America, South America, the Caribbean, Europe, Asia). Discuss how different parts of the world have become home to African-descended populations.

2. **Exploring Cultural and Historical Identity** (20-25 minutes)
   - **Video Clip**: Show a short video or documentary clip that highlights various Black cultures across the diaspora, such as the vibrant Afro-Caribbean, African-American, Afro-Brazilian, or Afro-European communities.
   - **Group Discussion**: After watching, facilitate a discussion about cultural identity, focusing on similarities and differences within the Black Diaspora. Questions to prompt discussion might include:
     - *What common threads do you notice in the lives of people of African descent across the world?*
     - *What are some unique cultural expressions (e.g., music, dance, spirituality) that come from different parts of the diaspora?*
   - **Reflection**: Encourage students to think about how these shared and diverse elements connect Black people globally, fostering a unique and multifaceted identity.

3. **What It Means to Be Black: Personal and Collective Identity** (20-25 minutes)
   - **Lecture**: Discuss how identity is both personal and collective. Explain that “being Black” can mean different things to different people but often includes shared experiences of resilience, pride, creativity, and overcoming challenges.
   - **Quotes and Inspiration**: Share quotes from notable Black figures that speak to the essence of Black identity (e.g., Maya Angelou, James Baldwin, Chinua Achebe, Audre Lorde, Malcolm X). Invite students to interpret these quotes and discuss how they relate to the themes of pride, strength, and connection within the Black community.
   - **Personal Reflection Activity**: Ask students to write down a few thoughts on what being Black means to them personally. Provide guiding prompts, such as:
     - *What makes you proud to be Black?*
     - *How does your family, culture, or community shape your identity?*
     - *What challenges have you experienced or observed that relate to your identity?*
     - *How does your identity connect you to others in the Black Diaspora?*

4. **Shared Challenges and Achievements Across the Black Diaspora** (20-25 minutes)
   - **Lecture**: Highlight common challenges that people of African descent have faced worldwide, such as discrimination, colonialism, and systemic racism. Emphasize the importance of resilience, unity, and allyship in overcoming these challenges.
   - **Group Activity**: In small groups, have students create a “Diaspora Pride Poster” highlighting aspects of Black resilience, achievements, or cultural contributions. Encourage them to think about:
     - *What accomplishments of Black communities inspire you?*
     - *What do you wish others knew about Black culture, history, or experiences?*
     - *What symbols, words, or images represent pride and resilience to you?*
   - **Share & Discuss**: Each group can share their poster with the class, explaining the message they hope to convey. Allow time for questions and discussion.

     - *How does today’s discussion impact your understanding of what it means to be Black?*
     - *What aspects of Black history or culture would you like to learn more about?*
     - *How do you see yourself contributing to or representing the Black Diaspora in the future?*
